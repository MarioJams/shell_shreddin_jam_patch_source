# Mario Jams Forced Mechanic Binary Patcher

This is the source code and tooling that generates the Mario Jams Shell Shredding Forced Mechanic binary patches. Place an elf file for SM64 decomp in the `elf` folder and run `make` (you will need to remove static from some functions to generate an elf file that is usable for this tool).
